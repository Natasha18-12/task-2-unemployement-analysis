Unemployment Analysis in India
This project analyzes unemployment data in India to understand key trends and patterns. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data, visualize insights, and explore relationships between different variables.

Project Structure
unemployment_analysis.py: This Python script contains the complete data analysis pipeline. It handles data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Unemployment in India.csv: The raw dataset used for this analysis.

cleaned_unemployment_data.csv: The output file generated by the script, which contains the cleaned and preprocessed data.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The script reads the raw data, handles missing values, and converts the 'Date' column to the correct format for time-series analysis.

Statistical Summary: It provides a descriptive statistical summary of the dataset to offer initial insights into the data distribution.

Trend Analysis: A line plot is generated to visualize the trend of the estimated unemployment rate in India over time. * Regional Comparison: A bar chart is created to show the average unemployment rate for different states, allowing for a clear comparison of regional disparities. * Correlation Analysis: A heatmap visualizes the correlation between the numerical features in the dataset, helping to identify strong relationships between variables.

Dataset
The analysis is based on a dataset containing information on unemployment in India. The key columns include Date, Region, and Estimated Unemployment Rate (%). The data captures monthly unemployment statistics, which are essential for trend and regional analysis.

Results
The Python script produces several visualizations and outputs that highlight significant findings from the data. These include:

Time-series plot of unemployment rates, which reveals how the rate has changed over the observed period.

Bar plot showing the average unemployment rate by state, helping to identify which states have higher or lower unemployment rates.

Correlation heatmap, which provides a quantitative understanding of the relationships between the numerical columns in the dataset.
